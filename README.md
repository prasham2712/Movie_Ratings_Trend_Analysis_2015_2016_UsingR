# Movie-Ratings-Trend-Analysis-2015-2016-

## Overview
This project analyzes Fandango's movie ratings data for 2015 and 2016 to explore trends in movie ratings and evaluate any changes following a bias correction in Fandango's rating system. The analysis includes data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to compare the distribution of movie ratings across both years.

## Key Findings
Slight Shift in Ratings: On average, popular movies from 2016 were rated slightly lower than those from 2015.

Bias Correction: The decrease in ratings for 2016 movies suggests that Fandango addressed the rating bias that was highlighted after Hickey's analysis.
